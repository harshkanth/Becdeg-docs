# Why BECDEG?

## A name, a legacy, a philosophy

BECDEG is more than an identity, it is the heart behind everything I do.

Each letter carries the essence of six lives that shaped mine in unforgettable ways, my beloved companions who gave me love, loyalty, wisdom, and an unspoken promise of always being there.

- **B** for **Bunny** – the guardian soul, always watching, always guiding
- **E** for **Elsa** – the graceful presence that whispered calm and clarity
- **C** for **Coco** – bold, affectionate, and full of unapologetic energy
- **D** for **Diana** – regal, fearless, and deeply intuitive
- **E** for **Cheekki** – sweet-natured, gentle, and full of warmth
- **G** for **Ginni** – curious, spirited, and endlessly inspiring

They aren't pets—they are companions, teachers, protectors, and soul family.  
Cheekki and Coco share the **"C"**, reminding me that life isn’t about perfectly distinct definitions—sometimes, stories intertwine, overlap, and strengthen each other.

## How BECDEG shapes my work

### Writing with depth and intention

As a **technical writer**, I don’t just write to inform—I write to *connect*.  
Every piece is designed to resonate emotionally, to make the reader feel seen and understood. That voice—calm, confident, and personal—comes from years of learning through the presence of my companions.

### Strategy with soul

As a **content strategist** and **designer**, I create systems that don’t just function—they *mean* something.  
Whether it’s crafting messaging architecture or aligning tone with brand personality, I approach every strategy through the lens of purpose and impact.  
The spirit of BECDEG reminds me to create with heart, not just logic.

### Documenting with care

This site itself—built using **MkDocs**, an example of how even technical or professional documentation can be beautiful and human.  
From UX writing to SOPs, I believe that every document should feel like it was written *for* someone, not just *at* them.

## In motion.

This site is a portfolio, but it’s also a tribute. To those who walk with me and the values I carry.  
BECDEG is not just a brand, it’s a living reminder that the most powerful work is built not just with skills, but with **heart**.

Thank you for taking the time to understand the soul behind it.
