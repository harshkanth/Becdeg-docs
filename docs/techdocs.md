# About Me

Hi, I'm Harsh Kanth — a **technical writer, content strategist, and documentation specialist** with over **10 years of experience** creating user-centric content that bridges the gap between products and people.

I craft documentation and content that doesn’t just explain, but elevates — helping teams communicate with clarity, scale knowledge effectively, and create experiences that stick.

That's me:
