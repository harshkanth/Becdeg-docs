# Welcome to My Documentation Portfolio

This site is a curated collection of my work as a **Technical Writer**, **Content Strategist**, and **Documentation Specialist** — designed to showcase the quality, depth, and versatility of the content I create.

Over the past **10 years**, I've helped companies simplify complexity, craft scalable documentation systems, and elevate user experience through precise, user-first content. Whether you're a **company looking to hire** a documentation expert, or a **client seeking a partner** to develop high-quality content for your product or platform — you're in the right place.

## Why This Portfolio Exists

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, content is more than just text — it's a product. Good documentation improves usability, reduces support costs, and builds trust. This site demonstrates my ability to:

- Create well-structured technical and product documentation  
- Design content strategies that scale with your business  
- Write with clarity, empathy, and a deep understanding of user needs  
- Use modern tools (MkDocs, Git, CI/CD, and more) to build docs the right way

## What You’ll Find Here

- 📄 **Sample Guides & Tutorials**: Realistic examples of user manuals, onboarding flows, and how-to docs  
- 🔍 **API & Developer Docs**: Reference docs and guides built with clarity and developer usability in mind  
- 🧠 **Content Strategy & Architecture Samples**: Structuring and planning documentation systems  
- ✍️ **UX & Microcopy Samples**: Interface writing that complements product flows and improves UX  
- 📚 **Process Documentation**: Internal wikis, knowledge bases, and ops documentation

Each section has been handpicked to reflect not only what I write, but how I think — with attention to structure, intent, and the user’s journey.
