# About Me

Hi, I'm **Harsh Kanth**—a **senior technical writer**, **content dessigner**, **documentation architect**, and **documentation specialist** with **10 years of experience** building world-class content systems for companies across domains like **SaaS**, **AI**, **fintech**, **e-commerce**, **insurtech**, **cloud**, and **retail tech**.

I create documentation and content that bridges complexity and clarity—enabling users to self-serve, developers to integrate, and products to grow faster.

That’s me:

## What I Do

I work across the full content lifecycle—from zero-to-one documentation builds to optimizing legacy systems.  
My core specialties include:

- **🛠 Technical writing**  
  End-user documentation, internal wikis, process flows, SDK manuals, CI/CD system guides, and training content (Camtasia)

- **🧑‍💻 API and developer documentation**  
  Integration content, Postman collections, JSON/YAML schema documentation, REST/Graph API references, and platform onboarding

- **🧠 Content strategy and architecture**  
  Documentation site structure planning, taxonomy design, Git-based workflows, and content governance across teams

- **✍️ UX writing and microcopy**  
  In-app instructions, modal content, error messages, tooltips, and onboarding flows—written with empathy and product logic

- **📢 Content writing and SEO**  
  Web copy, product descriptions, blogs, whitepapers, case studies, and ghostwritten content for global clients

- Worked with global brands like **Microsoft**, **Amazon**, **BMW USA**, and **Western Union** (direct and ghostwriting)  
- Led documentation teams at **OneShield**, **Vision Group**, and **Fusioni Technologies**

## My Approach

Every document, guide, or help article I create follows four key principles:

- **Clarity**—Language that’s accessible and user-centered  
- **Structure**—Organized with reusability and scalability in mind  
- **Empathy**—Designed to solve real user and developer pain points  
- **Maintainability**—Easy to evolve as the product grows

Whether I am building from scratch or auditing legacy documentation, I focus on writing that works—for your users, your product, and your business.
