# Welcome to My Documentation Portfolio

This site is a curated collection of my work as a **Technical Writer**, **Content Strategist**, **UX Writer**, and **Documentation Specialist** — designed to showcase the depth, precision, and versatility of the content I create.

With over **10 years of experience**, I’ve led and delivered end-to-end documentation for Fortune 500s, product startups, agencies, and cross-functional tech teams. From building doc systems for **Microsoft Teams** to creating platform-wide architecture content for **OneShield**, this portfolio reflects how I simplify complexity and structure knowledge at scale.

## Why This Portfolio Exists

In today’s digital-first ecosystem, documentation is no longer an afterthought — it's a product, a brand experience, and a strategic asset.

  **I created this site to:**

- Showcase my ability to own the  **entire documentation lifecycle** — from **initial planning** and **architecture** to **final publishing** and **optimization**
- Demonstrate my comfort across documentation platforms,** Git-based workflows**,** theming**, **SEO**, and **developer tools**
- Provide a live example of how I approach documentation design — **user-first**, **scalable**, and **technically sound**
- Demonstrate **how I think about documentation** — not just what I write  
- Share examples of my real-world work, structure, and problem-solving  
- Offer **clients, recruiters, and collaborators** a first-hand look at the quality of content I deliver  
- Show my comfort with tools like **MkDocs**, **Markdown**, **Git**, and CI/CD environments — all of which I use daily

I’ve built documentation for AI/ML systems, SDKs, API platforms, image recognition tools, insurance products, and fintech apps — and I understand how content aligns with product design, engineering workflows, and user psychology.
