# Welcome to My Documentation Portfolio

This site is a curated collection of my work as a **Senior** and **Lead technical writer**, **content strategist** and **designer**, **UX writer**, and **documentation acrchitect** and **owner** — designed to showcase the depth, precision, and versatility of the content I create.

With over **10 years of experience**, I have led and delivered end-to-end documentation for Fortune 500 companies, product startups, agencies, and cross-functional tech teams. From building documentation systems for **Microsoft Teams** to creating platform-wide architecture content for **OneShield**, this portfolio reflects how I simplify complexity and structure knowledge at scale.

## Why This Portfolio Exists

In today’s digital-first ecosystem, documentation is no longer an afterthought—it’s a product, a brand experience, and a strategic asset.

**I created this site to:**

- Showcase my ability to own the **entire documentation lifecycle**—from initial planning and architecture to final publishing and optimization  
- Demonstrate my comfort with **documentation platforms**, **Git-based workflows**, **theming**, **SEO**, and **developer tools**  
- Provide a live example of how I approach documentation design—**user-first**, **scalable**, and **technically sound**  
- Show how I think about documentation—not just what I write  
- Share examples of my **real-world work**, **structure**, and **problem-solving**  
- Offer **clients, recruiters, and collaborators** a firsthand look at the quality of content I deliver  
- Highlight my experience using tools like **MkDocs**, **Markdown**, **Git**, and **CI/CD environments**—all of which I use daily

I have built documentation for AI/ML systems, SDKs, API platforms, image recognition tools, insurance products, and fintech apps—and I understand how content aligns with product design, engineering workflows, and user psychology.
